# Remediation - Attaching AWS IAM Roles To EC2 Instances
[AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/) roles enable your applications running on Amazon EC2 instance to use temporary security credentials. IAM roles for EC2 make it easier for your applications to make API requests securely from an instance because they do not require you to manage AWS security credentials that the applications use. Recently, AWS enabled to use temporary security credentials for your applications by attaching an IAM role to an existing EC2 instance by using the AWS Console.

When you use a role, you don't have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a user name and password or access keys) to an EC2 instance. Instead, the role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use when they make calls to other AWS resources. When you launch an EC2 instance, you specify an IAM role to associate with the instance. Applications that run on the instance can then use the role-supplied temporary credentials to sign API requests.

> Remediation Tool   - [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)

> Remediation Script - [playbook.yml](playbook.yml)

## Remediation Requirements
The below requirements are needed to execute remediation script

> pip packages
- python >= 3.6

- botocore >= 1.18.0

> Ansible Collection

This remedaition required the [community.aws collection](https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/aws) (version 2.4.0).

To install it, use: 
```sh
ansible-galaxy collection install community.aws
```
